Yongxin Yang is a Lecturer in Financial Technology at Queen Mary University of London. Previously, he was a Lecturer in Machine Learning at University of Surrey.

He received his PhD from QMUL in 2017, supervised by [Professor Timothy Hospedales](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/ "The Best PhD Supervisor!").

His research is in the area of machine learning (transfer learning, domain generalization, and meta learning) and its applications in finance (portfolio optimization and derivatives pricing) and medical genetics.

Apart from being a (rather casual) researcher, he is an ACCA certified accountant and a professional web designer. He co-founded a few companies and holds some consulting roles in industry.
