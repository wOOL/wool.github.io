    <h1>Privacy Statement for Dx Viewer</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 19 July 2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dx Viewer, an innovative application developed by Yang's Accounting Consultancy Ltd. This Privacy Statement outlines our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use our app. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>

    <h3>Front Camera Access</h3>
    <p>Dx Viewer requires access to your device's front camera. This permission is necessary for capturing an X-ray image from a screen, which is integral to the app's functionality.</p>

    <h3>Image Processing</h3>
    <p>Once the X-ray image is captured, it is transmitted to our inference server, where a machine learning model analyzes the image to predict potential diseases. The analyzed image, with bounding boxes and labels indicating possible diseases, is then sent back to your device.</p>

    <h3>User Controls</h3>
    <p>You have the option to adjust the sensitivity of the machine learning model by tuning the "confidence score" parameter. This allows you to customize the sensitivity level according to your preferences.</p>

    <h3>Performance Notice</h3>
    <p>Please be aware that the initial use of the app may take some time, as the inference server requires a warm-up period.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>No Image Retention</h3>
    <p>We do not store the captured images or the analysis results on our servers after they are sent back to you. This ensures that your data remains private and secure.</p>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>
    <p>We implement robust security measures to protect your data during transmission and processing. However, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Purpose and Use</h2>
    <p>Dx Viewer is designed for educational purposes, targeting junior dentists to aid in their learning and professional development. It is not intended for clinical or diagnostic use.</p>

    <h2>Updates to This Privacy Statement</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Statement from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Statement periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
